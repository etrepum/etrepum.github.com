I no longer work at Facebook. I tried it for four months, but I just couldn't
find anything there that made it worth two hours on the road to spend
another eight hours at a desk. I've been spoiled with a walk/bike
commute for too long to go back to driving, and I'm not at all
interested in moving to the suburbs. Other than the commute, the only
part I didn't care for was that they
expected to have some control over non-Facebook aspects of my life
(angel investments, conference speaking, open source, outbound
communication in general). The process for getting permission to do
this kind of thing at Facebook isn't too onerous, and I
understand why they do it, so that was really just an annoyance.

Facebook is a fantastic place to work, which I can say honestly because they're
no longer paying me. The work is challenging, and everyone I worked with there
is amazing. I'd highly recommend working at Facebook (if you
plan to live near of one of their campuses: Menlo Park, Seattle, 
New York, London, &hellip;).  I learned a tremendous amount about how a large
organization can be run well, but my favorite part of the whole experience was
[Bryan's](https://twitter.com/bos31337 "Bryan O'Sullivan (@bos31337)")
Haskell class. I'll have more to say about Haskell and why I think
it's interesting later. I'm also really going to miss the great
technical discussions, memes and trolling on the internal groups. It's
hard to find that kind of community elsewhere on the internet.

Now that I can have the flexible life of an entrepreneur again, I plan to
spend a lot more time at home with my awesome wife
[Margaret](https://twitter.com/elektradarling "Mary Margaret Wadsworth-Smith Ippolito (@elektradarling)")
and our mostly awesome dogs
[Ramsey](https://www.facebook.com/RamseyIppolito) and
[Izzy](https://www.facebook.com/IzzyDogIppolito). As for my programming
addiction, I intend to continue learning Haskell, go to some conferences,
do some new open source, and collaborate on a few indie iOS apps/games.
Long-term I have my sights set on doing something for education
space, but I have a lot of research ahead of me to figure out what I should
be doing and how it could work. If you have any ideas, particularly with regard
to facilitating self-teaching of programming, math, science, and/or language with fun
software, I'd love to hear them!
