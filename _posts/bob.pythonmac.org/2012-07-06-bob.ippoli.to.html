<p>
	It's been a while since I've updated this blog. Life intervened. I
	became annoyed with the blogging platform. I lost motivation. Twitter
	was a good enough outlet. The excuses aren't interesting, so I'll stop.
</p>
<h2>bob.ippoli.to</h2>
<p>
	A few months ago I decided it was time to rebrand. The domain
	<em>bob.pythonmac.org</em> and the title
	<em>from __future__ import *</em> reflected one thing I was
	very interested in nearly a decade ago. I still like Python and
	I continue to use Mac as my workstation platform almost exclusively, but
	I also do a lot of other things. Since I'm pretty sure my name
	isn't going to change in the next decade or two, I decided
	to just go with <em>bob.ippoli.to</em> and drop the clever title.
</p>
<h2>Blogofile &rarr; GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>
	I was no longer happy with my blogging platform.
	<a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a> was great at the time
	but maintaining a Python environment to run it became a chore over the
	years. I wanted to lower the barrier to posting for my future self as
	much as possible. <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
	with its 
	<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">built-in Jekyll support</a>
	was the solution I decided on. I still have the option to
	build it locally, but posting is just a git push away.
</p>
<h2>Jekyll-<del>Bootstrap</del></h2>
<p>
	Initially I thought I wanted to build something based on
	<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>,
	so I stumbled upon
	<a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> which seemed
	like it would make that easy. After getting something working, I decided that
	Bootstrap wasn't a good fit. I could do something a lot simpler than that.
	I wanted an elegant and simple design that worked well on desktop and mobile.
	I'll probably end up stripping out the rest of the Jekyll-Bootstrap code
	since I don't benefit from its indirection.
</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>
	Inspired by <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and
	<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">zeldman.com</a> I decided to modernize
	the HTML from Jekyll-Bootstrap and build a new theme CSS from scratch.
	Big text and bigger buttons. This took me a long time, I'm not a designer.
	I managed to get most of it done in Russia under an antibiotic haze
	during my recovery from a very gnarly case of tonsilitis.
	I had a lot of help from <a href="http://dochub.io/">DocHub</a>,
	<a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>
	(and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso">espresso</a>).
	CSS3 is really powerful and maybe even elegant, but it is not a very good
	example of <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>. If I had to do
	a lot of CSS, I think I'd have to switch to
	<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> or
	<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a>.
</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>
	I'm not so sure what's next here. I've got a few months of notes that I
	made while working on <a href="http://www.pieceable.com">Pieceable</a>
	that I may try and organize. I've got a
	<a href="http://bob.ippoli.to/rndchoice_efl_2012/">Random Choice</a> talk
	that I gave at
	<a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Moscow2012">Moscow Erlang Factory Lite 2012</a>
	that I'd like to flesh out. I'm also starting at Facebook in about a week,
	and with that long bus commute I think I can make some time to write about
	my experience there.
